# I'm Maya Uwaydat, and welcome to my corner of the Internet. 
## Well...a corner where I'm not entirely anonymous. 

- Hometown: Little Rock, Arkansas
- Hobbies: Writing, making electronic music, drawing, some video games here and there, researching topics I like
- First Computer I Ever Saw: My father had this massive DELL desktop with this big monitor that I would mess around on as a kid. I'd try to change the fonts and colors of everything. The oldest computer I've ever interacted with in person was my mom's old Windows XP she had used for work. I was very fond of Clippy and honestly still am. 
- About me: I dunno. Where do I start with a question like this?
