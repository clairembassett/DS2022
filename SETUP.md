# Getting Started

Complete the following before the first class:

- [ ] Take the [**Student Survey**]().

### Services

- [ ] Create a [**GitHub**](https://github.com/) account.
- [ ] Create an [**AWS Account**](https://signin.aws.amazon.com/signup?request_type=register). This requires payment for any services used. I recommend buying a prepaid credit card ($50-$100 max) and using it to create your new Amazon Web Services account with the “Free Tier.” 
- [ ] Create a free [**Docker account**](https://app.docker.com/signup) to use with Docker Desktop.

### Software

- [ ] MacOS users: Find the **Terminal** app (in Applications -> Utilities). You may want to add it to your dock.
- [ ] Windows users: [**Install and set up WSL**](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install), the Windows Subsystem for Linux. The basic WSL installation will create an Ubuntu environment for you. The username and password you create within WSL does not have to match your Windows username/password. 
- [ ] Install [**Docker Desktop**](https://www.docker.com/get-started/) on your laptop and sign in using the Docker account you created above.
- [ ] Install [**VS Code**](https://code.visualstudio.com/), the free IDE (integrated development environment), in your primary OS.
- [ ] Install the [**`git` command line**](https://git-scm.com/downloads) for your OS. Windows users may want to install it both in Windows and within WSL. 
- [ ] Install [**`jq`**](https://jqlang.github.io/jq/) for your OS.

Python:

- [ ] Find or install Python3 on your laptop. Version 3.9 or higher is preferable. You should be able to invoke it interactively from your terminal with:

        $ python3

    If you do not have Python installed, then:

- [ ] MacOS users can install from [Pytyon.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/) or by using `homebrew`.
- [ ] Windows users can install from [Python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
- [ ] Within Windows WSL you can install Python3:

        $ apt update
        $ apt install python3 python3-pip

    Once you have a working version of Python on your laptop you need to point VS Code to it. Try creating a sample Python project and making this connection yourself.
