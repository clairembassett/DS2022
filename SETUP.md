# Getting Started

Complete the following before the first class:

- [ ] Take the [**Student Survey**]().
- [ ] Create a [**GitHub**](https://github.com/) account.
- [ ] Create an [**AWS Account**](https://signin.aws.amazon.com/signup?request_type=register). This requires payment for any services used. I recommend buying a prepaid credit card ($50-$100 max) and using it to create your new Amazon Web Services account with the “Free Tier.” 
- [ ] Install [**Docker Desktop**](https://www.docker.com/get-started/) on your laptop.
- [ ] Create a free [**Docker account**](https://app.docker.com/signup) to use with Docker Desktop.
- [ ] Mac users: Find the **Terminal** app (in Applications -> Utilities). You may want to add it to your dock.
- [ ] Windows users: [**Install and set up WSL**](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install), the Windows Subsystem for Linux. The basic WSL installation will create an Ubuntu environment for you. The username and password you create for WSL does not have to match your Windows username/password. 
- [ ] Install [**VS Code**](https://code.visualstudio.com/), the free IDE (integrated development environment), in your primary OS.
- [ ] Install the [**`git` command line**](https://git-scm.com/downloads) for your OS. Windows users may want to install it both in Windows and within WSL.
